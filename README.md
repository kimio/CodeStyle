- Clang Format
Clang is a compiler front end for the programming languages C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, OpenMP,[5] OpenCL, and CUDA. It uses LLVM as its back end and has been part of the LLVM release cycle since LLVM 2.6.

It is designed to be able to replace the full GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Its contributors include Apple, Microsoft, Google, ARM, Sony, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It is open-source software,[6] with source code released under the University of Illinois/NCSA License, a permissive free software licence.

The Clang project includes the Clang front end and the Clang static analyzer and several code analysis tools
